    <p class="mb-6">
      Hello! Iâ€™m Arnelle, a software developer based in Cebu, Philippines. I enjoy building things using good old HTML,
      CSS, JavaScript, and Web Platform APIs.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I'm a Google Developers Expert in Web Technologies, and an active volunteer and speaker for local tech
      communities, giving talks and conducting workshops about various technical topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      When not busy experimenting with new Web APIs, I like to spend my time taking photos, playing video games, or
      practicing my card tricks.
